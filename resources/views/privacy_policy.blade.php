                                which is a data controller of your personal data.<br /><br />We have adopted this
                                Privacy Policy, which determines how we are processing the information collected by
                                https://www.ip-screens.com/, which also provides the reasons why we must collect certain
                                personal data about you. Therefore, you must read this Privacy Policy before using
                                https://www.ip-screens.com/&nbsp;website.<br /><br />We take care of your personal data
                                and undertake to guarantee its confidentiality and security.<br /><br />Personal
                                information we collect:<br />When you visit the https://www.ip-screens.com/, we
                                automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about
                                your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the installed cookies on your
                                device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the
                                individual web pages or products you view, what websites or search terms referred you to
                                the Site, and how you interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected
                                information as “Device Information.” Moreover, we might collect the personal data you
                                provide to us (including but not limited to Name, Surname, Address, payment information,
                                etc.) during registration to be able to fulfill the agreement.<br /><br />Why do we
                                process your data?<br />Our top priority is customer data security, and, as such, we may
                                process only minimal user data, only as much as it is absolutely necessary to maintain
                                the website. Information collected automatically is used only to identify potential
                                cases of abuse and establish statistical information regarding website usage. This
                                statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that it would identify
                                any particular user of the system.<br /><br />You can visit the website without telling
                                us who you are or revealing any information, by which someone could identify you as a
                                specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to use some of the website’s
                                features, or you wish to receive our newsletter or provide other details by filling a
                                form, you may provide personal data to us, such as your email, first name, last name,
                                city of residence, organization, telephone number. You can choose not to provide us with
                                your personal data, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the
                                website’s features. For example, you won’t be able to receive our Newsletter or contact
                                us directly from the website. Users who are uncertain about what information is
                                mandatory are welcome to contact us via info@ip-screens.com&nbsp;.<br /><br />Your
                                rights:<br />If you are a European resident, you have the following rights related to

                                restrict processing.<br />The right to data portability.<br />The right to
                                object.<br />Rights in relation to automated decision-making and profiling.<br />If you
                                would like to exercise this right, please contact us through the contact information
                                below.<br /><br />Additionally, if you are a European resident, we note that we are
                                processing your information in order to fulfill contracts we might have with you (for
                                example, if you make an order through the Site), or otherwise to pursue our legitimate
                                business interests listed above. Additionally, please note that your information might
                                be transferred outside of Europe, including Canada and the United
                                States.<br /><br />Links to other websites:<br />Our website may contain links to other
                                websites that are not owned or controlled by us. Please be aware that we are not

                                encourage you to be aware when you leave our website and read the privacy statements of
                                each website that may collect personal information.<br /><br />Information
                                security:<br />We secure information you provide on computer servers in a controlled,
                                secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We keep
                                reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect against
                                unauthorized access, use, modification, and personal data disclosure in its control and
                                custody. However, no data transmission over the Internet or wireless network can be
                                guaranteed.<br /><br />Legal disclosure:<br />We will disclose any information we
                                collect, use or receive if required or permitted by law, such as to comply with a
                                subpoena or similar legal process, and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is
                                necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others,
                                investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.<br /><br />Contact
                                information:<br />If you would like to contact us to understand more about this Policy
